## Add and Remove Fields

To optimize the data visualized you can select which of the result fields should be displayed or hidden. 

Fields can be added/removed from both the [Fields panel](searching-data-displaying-fields.html "Display Fields") and the Tool panel under Search. From the Tool panel you can add formatting to the field as well. 

### Fields Panel

  1. Run a query as explained in [Write new queries](writing-queries-manage-write.html "Write new queries"). 

  2. In the [Fields panel](searching-data-displaying-fields.html "Display Fields"), click the + or - signs next to each field (see [Figure 75, ‚ÄúFields Panel‚Äù](searching-data-displaying-fields.html#figure_searching-data-displaying-fields1 "Figure¬†75.¬†Fields Panel")): 

     * + adds the field to the currently displayed result. 

     * - removes the field from the currently displayed result. 




### Note

By default, LogScale displays fields coming from 200 events at most. You can display more data by clicking Fetch more. 

From the [Fields panel](searching-data-displaying-fields.html "Display Fields"), you can also click on a field name and get quick access to filtering options: 

  * ‚äú ‚Äî Match value in query 

  * ‚Äî Exclude value in query 




### Tool Panel

  1. Run a query as explained in [Write new queries](writing-queries-manage-write.html "Write new queries"). 

  2. From the Tool panel, click the Format Event List icon (the brush) to expand it.

  3. The Format event list panel, that appears when clicking the Format Event List icon (the brush), stands as a separate area on the right-hand side of the User Interface and shows only the fields added as columns in the Event list.
