### Event List Usage and Data Format

The following columns are typically displayed in the Event List. 

[@timestamp](searching-data-event-fields.html#searching-data-event-fields-metadata-timestamp) and [@rawstring](searching-data-event-fields.html#searching-data-event-fields-metadata-rawstring) columns are displayed by default in a given format. For example, [@rawstring](searching-data-event-fields.html#searching-data-event-fields-metadata-rawstring) is displayed as Log line format. However, the formatting for fields in the Event List can be changed, see [Field Data Types](searching-data-types.html "Field Data Types") for more information. 

Field |  Type |  Description   
---|---|---  
[@id](searching-data-event-fields.html#searching-data-event-fields-metadata-id) |  string |  Metadata field automatically generated by LogScale for all events.   
[@timestamp](searching-data-event-fields.html#searching-data-event-fields-metadata-timestamp) |  datetime |  The timestamp of the events is used to order events in the list.   
[@rawstring](searching-data-event-fields.html#searching-data-event-fields-metadata-rawstring) |  string |  The content of the line. Usually this value is automatically assigned during parsing.   
  
Event List will list as many results as returned by the LogScale server, which defaults to the `200` most recent events of the search interval. You can increase this by using the [`tail()`](functions-tail.html "tail\(\)") function, for example `tail(1000)`, but this can cause performance issues in the web interface if too many elements are rendered. 

You can use the keyboard to navigate the event. **Alt** +**Ctrl** +**Down** and **Alt** +**Ctrl** +**Up** will move the selection up and down the list, while displaying the fields in the inspection panel. 

#### ANSI code support

Attention

### Feature Availability

ANSI escaping of results is only available for Self-Hosted customers, controlled by the [`ReplaceANSIEscapeCodes`](https://library.humio.com/falcon-logscale-self-hosted/configuration-dynamic-config-settingdetails-replace-ansi-escape-codes.html) dynamic configuration variable. 

In Cloud environments, ANSI code support has been removed starting from version 1.112.1. See [Troubleshooting: **ANSI Escape Codes Trigger a Warning**](https://library.humio.com/kb/kb-ansi-escaping.html) for more information. 

The [`Event List`](widgets-eventlist.html "Event List") widget supports ANSI codes for colour markup and text formatting. To use ANSI codes, you must escape the ANSI markup using the hexadecimal character, either `\x1B` or `\u0018`. 

The ANSI markup only works for unstructured text within the [`Event List`](widgets-eventlist.html "Event List"), whether in the search or a dashboard. You cannot use ANSI markup within titles or other text, and ANSI codes are not interpreted for XML or JSON formatted data. 

For example, here is how you can set the [@rawstring](searching-data-event-fields.html#searching-data-event-fields-metadata-rawstring) by adding a colorized element: 

logscale
    
    
    @rawstring:="Colorizing \x1B[31m some \u001B[0m text"
