## Event List

The [Event List](searching-data-changing-the-events-display.html "Display Results and Events") widget is LogScale's primary tool for real-time event display as logs are ingested. It displays individual log entries (events) in a chronological list format, making it the fundamental visualization component of the [`Search`](searching-data.html "Search Data") interface page. 

Think of each event as a structured entry from a log file, containing multiple fields of data. This widget allows you to: 

  * View raw log lines and parsed fields 

  * Scroll through events within your selected time range 

  * Look at events more thoroughly and apply quick filters directly from displayed values, see [Inspect Events](searching-data-inspecting-events.html "Inspect Events") for more information. 




Default view on the [`Search`](searching-data.html "Search Data") page, this widget serves as the starting point for most log investigation and troubleshooting tasks.
