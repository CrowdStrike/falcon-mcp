## Saved Searches

It is possible to save search results, queries, dashboard widgets, and more. As it can take some time to construct a search query and if used often, saving searches and different dashboards for reuse is time saving. 

In the [Results panel](searching-data-changing-the-events-display.html "Display Results and Events"), click Save, and select one of the following options: 

  * Saved search. You can make a saved query of your search. See [Save searches](writing-queries-manage-save-new.html "Save searches") for more information.

  * Dashboard widget. If your search is visualized as one of the available widgets, you can save that widget for future use. See [_Dashboards_](dashboards.html "Dashboards") for more information. 

  * Trigger. You can save a query as a trigger (if the type of search is appropriate), including scheduled searches. See [Triggers](automated-alerts.html "Triggers") for more information. 

  * Export to File. This option will export the results of the query, all that is shown in the [Results panel](searching-data-changing-the-events-display.html "Display Results and Events"), to a file locally. See [Export Data](searching-data-data-export.html "Export Data") for more information.
