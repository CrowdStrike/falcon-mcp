## Assign End of Search Time Interval to Field - Example 1

Assign the end of the search time interval to a field using the [`end()`](https://library.humio.com/data-analysis/functions-end.html) function 

### Query

flowchart LR; %%{init: {"flowchart": {"defaultRenderer": "elk"}} }%% repo{{Events}} 1>Augment Data] result{{Result Set}} repo --> 1 1 --> result

logscale
    
    
    e := end()

### Introduction

The [`end()`](https://library.humio.com/data-analysis/functions-end.html) function is used to assign the end of the search time interval to a field provided by the parameter [_`as`_](https://library.humio.com/data-analysis/functions-end.html#query-functions-end-as). The [`end()`](https://library.humio.com/data-analysis/functions-end.html) function is equivalent to the [`now()`](https://library.humio.com/data-analysis/functions-now.html) function â€” that is: the current time. 

In this example, the [`end()`](https://library.humio.com/data-analysis/functions-end.html) function is used to assign the end of the search time interval to a field named e. 

### Step-by-Step

  1. Starting with the source repository events.

  2. flowchart LR; %%{init: {"flowchart": {"defaultRenderer": "elk"}} }%% repo{{Events}} 1>Augment Data] result{{Result Set}} repo --> 1 1 --> result style 1 fill:#ff0000,stroke-width:4px,stroke:#000;

logscale
         
         e := end()

Assigns the value of end to a new field named e. 

  3. Event Result set.




### Summary and Results

The query is used to assign the end of the search time interval to a specified field. Assigning end of search time interval to a field is useful when, for example, searching for security events. When doing a query, the events you are searching do not know the span of the search (the system just returns a list of the events in the given time interval), but you might want to show the relative time of the event timestamp compared to the search window. For example, if you search of a bunch of events that happened yesterday and you are searching from `yesterday 00:00 to 23:59`, you then want to calculate '3 hours before' or even '2s before' because when searching for security events that time difference may be important.
