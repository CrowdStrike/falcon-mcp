### Use saved queries in interactions

You can use saved queries to save interactions on the [`Search`](searching-data.html "Search Data") page, thus avoiding recreation of the same interaction at every search. For more information on the interactions that LogScale supports, see [Event List Interactions](searching-data-search-interactions.html "Event List Interactions") and [Work with Dashboard Interactions](dashboards-interactive-interactions.html "Work with Dashboard Interactions"). 

You can either: 

  * Load a saved query with interaction from the Queries dropdown and click the Saved tab (or pick a saved query from a package):

  * Make an interaction from a query you have created and save it in a new saved query â€” or save your interaction in an existing saved query. 

From the Results panel, click Save and select the Saved search option to open the Save query dialog box, where you save your query along with the interaction you have created.
