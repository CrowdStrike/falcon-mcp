# Data Visualization

LogScale displays log data in real-time visualizations. You can create custom dashboards and widgets to organize these visualizations. 

LogScale allows you to visualize and organize log data in real-time. 

You can customize your data visualization by selecting from multiple display layouts to best represent your data. These visualizations update dynamically as queries run. 

The main components of LogScale visualization are dashboards and widgets: 

  * A _dashboard_ is a collection of multiple visualization elements (widgets) to organize and display query results in a single, unified view. It serves as an interactive interface that provides real-time monitoring and analysis of log data, which can be shared across teams and organizations for collaborative use. 

For more information, see [_Dashboards_](dashboards.html "Dashboards"). 

  * A _widget_ is an individual visualization tool that lives within a dashboard and displays specific query results in various formats such as charts, tables, or diagrams. Widgets act as the essential building blocks that transform raw data into meaningful visual representations, and they can be configured, resized, and arranged to create comprehensive dashboard layouts. 

For more information, see [_Widgets_](widgets.html "Widgets").
